# SlackAuditor
A Python script to log messages on Slack using Slack's bot API.

This script was created in order to automate a specific report at work, so it's very focused and doesn't have many options for extensibility.  
As the report is no longer being generated and nothing similar is being requested at the moment, it's unlikely that I'll refactor this code to make it more general.
